# 🐍 Object-Oriented System Simulations

A collection of console-based applications simulating real-world systems, designed to demonstrate advanced **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Smart Parking Management System (`parking_system.py`)
A comprehensive management system for university technoparks.
- **Key Features:** Custom exception handling, dynamic fee calculation based on user type (Student vs Staff), and capacity management.
- **Tech Stack:** `Encapsulation`, `Polymorphism`, `Custom Exceptions`.

### 2. Hospital Management System (`hospital_system.py`)
A simulation of doctor-patient interactions.
- **Key Features:** Patient admission, doctor assignment, and specialty tracking.
- **Tech Stack:** `Inheritance`, `Class Relationships`.

### 3. Secure ATM Simulation (`atm_simulation.py`)
A banking interface focusing on security and transaction integrity.
- **Key Features:** PIN validation, balance protection, and deposit/withdrawal logic.
- **Tech Stack:** `Encapsulation`, `Property Decorators`.

## 🚀 Technical Concepts Demonstrated
This repository serves as a practical implementation of the following concepts (see `OOP_Concepts/` folder for isolated examples):

- **Encapsulation:** Protected attributes (`_balance`, `_pin`) and `@property` decorators.
- **Inheritance:** Base `Person` class extended by `Doctor` and `Patient`.
- **Polymorphism:** Overridden methods for different pass types (Student/Staff).
- **Abstraction:** Interface definitions using `ABC` (Abstract Base Classes).
- **Error Handling:** Custom exception hierarchies for robust error management.
